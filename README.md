Comments about the app
-----------------
* I have chosen to design and solve the problem in an object oriented approach and by creating a game show like feeling, 
even though the problem could be proven using less code. But then the app would be more primitive.
* I have also chosen to design the app focusing on solving the original problem and therefore did not design it to support 
more than three boxes. Even if it is easily done it also adds a little more noise for the reader. 
* Handling errors gracefully is also not in the scope for this application
